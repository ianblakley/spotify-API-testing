# Spotify API Testing
Messing around with some Spotify API functions to do things like shuffle a playlist and give me my most streamed songs all time.

Disclaimer: For the purpose of sharing this code publicly without releasing my own personal Spotify information, I have some values such as the client ID saved in a separate .env file read by the code. This can be recreated by creating your own .env file in the same directory as your file and saving something like your client ID in the .env file as CLIENT_ID = "your client id"
